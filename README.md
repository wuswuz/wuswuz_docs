This is a product documentation tool. The goal of this product is to make it easier to manage a large number of features of your product.

Why was this app created? It came from my personal experience. One day, I had multiple tasks to complete, and one of the features was unknown to everyone. I started asking my team, but no one knew what the feature looked like. Eventually, I created my own documentation to solve the problem. I hope this tool will also help others facing similar challenges
